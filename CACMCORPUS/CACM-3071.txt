an
algorithm
using
symbolic
techniques
for
the
bel
petrov
of
gravitational
fields
in
this
note
an
algorithm
is
presented
for
the
symbolic
calculation
of
certain
algebraic
invariants
of
the
weyl
tensor
which
permits
the
determination
of
the
bel
petrov
of
a
gravitational
field
this
algorithm
although
more
specialized
than
that
of
dinverno
and
russell
clark
neither
the
use
of
a
special
coordinate
system
nor
the
spin
coefficient
formalism
the
algorithm
has
been
implemented
in
formac
and
is
designed
to
complete
the
classification
scheme
proposed
by
petrov
in
his
book
an
appendix
contains
examples
illustrating
the
use
of
the
algorithm
