minimal
total
processing
and
disk
scheduling
disciplines
this
article
investigates
the
application
of
minimal
total
processing
time
to
rotating
storage
units
when
random
arrival
of
requests
is
allowed
fixed
head
and
moving
head
and
moving
head
storage
units
are
considered
and
emphasis
is
placed
on
the
relative
merits
of
the
mtpt
scheduling
discipline
with
respect
to
the
shortest
latency
time
first
the
results
of
the
simulation
studies
presented
show
that
neither
scheduling
discipline
is
unconditionally
superior
to
the
other
for
most
fixed
head
applications
the
sltf
discipline
is
preferable
to
mtpt
but
for
intra
cylinder
scheduling
the
mtpt
discipline
offers
a
distinct
advantage
over
the
sltf
discipline
the
computational
requirements
of
an
algorithm
that
implements
the
mtpt
scheduling
discipline
are
shown
to
be
comparable
to
sltf
algorithms
in
both
cases
the
sorting
procedure
is
the
most
time
consuming
of
the
algorithm
