n
dimensional
for
detecting
and
correcting
multiple
errors
the
paper
introduces
a
new
family
of
codes
for
detecting
and
correcting
multiple
errors
in
a
binary
coded
the
message
itself
is
arranged
conceptually
into
a
multidimensional
rectangular
array
the
processes
of
encoding
and
error
detection
are
based
upon
parity
evaluations
along
prescribed
dimensions
of
the
array
effectiveness
of
the
codes
is
increased
by
introducing
a
system
check
bit
which
is
essentially
a
parity
check
on
the
other
parity
bits
only
three
dimensional
are
discussed
in
this
paper
with
parity
evaluations
along
the
horizontal
the
vertical
and
one
main
diagonal
however
the
family
of
codes
is
not
restricted
to
three
dimensions
as
evidenced
by
the
discussion
by
minnick
and
ashenhurst
on
a
similar
multidimensional
single
bit
plan
used
for
another
purpose
a
four
dimensional
correcting
three
and
detecting
four
errors
has
been
developed
the
extension
to
higher
dimensional
with
greater
correction
power
is
straightforward
