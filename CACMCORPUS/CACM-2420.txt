automatic
theorem
provers
to
be
made
much
more
efficient
with
this
in
mind
slagle
has
shown
how
the
axioms
for
partial
ordering
can
be
replaced
by
built
in
rules
when
using
a
particular
theorem
proving
based
upon
hyper
resolution
paramodulation
the
new
rules
embody
the
transitivity
of
partial
orderings
and
the
close
relationship
between
predicates
a
program
has
been
developed
using
a
modified
version
of
these
rules
this
new
theorem
prover
been
found
to
be
very
powerful
for
solving
problems
involving
partial
orderings
this
paper
presents
a
detailed
description
of
the
program
and
a
comprehensive
account
of
the
experiments
that
have
been
performed

it
