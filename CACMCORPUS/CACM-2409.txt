an
algorithm
for
the
approximate
solution
of
wiener
hopf
equations
an
explicit
approximate
solution
is
given
for
an
equation
where
it
is
assumed
that
the
classical
wiener
hopf
may
be
applied
it
is
furthermore
assumed
that
fourier
transforms
are
known
explicitly
the
approximate
solution
depends
on
two
positive
parameters
