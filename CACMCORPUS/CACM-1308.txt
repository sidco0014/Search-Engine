a
mathematical
model
for
mechanical
part
description
the
flexibility
of
a
mathematical
model
takes
advantage
of
the
common
information
requirements
of
computer
aided
drawing
numerical
control
tape
generation
and
physical
characteristic
computation
by
judicious
control
of
man
machine
requirements
improved
results
over
conventional
engineering
design
processes
are
possible
an
english
like
language
tailored
for
use
by
draftsmen
and
designers
will
describe
the
part
and
specify
the
output
desired
one
approach
to
the
mathematical
model
consists
of
a
group
of
surface
defining
equations
which
are
created
by
a
system
of
modular
subprogram
other
subprograms
will
convert
the
mathematical
model
into
instructions
for
driving
automatic
drafting
machines
and
numerical
controlled
machine
tools
physical
part
characteristics
such
as
center
of
gravity
can
be
computed
by
subprograms
and
used
in
dynamic
analysis
work
the
proposed
overall
system
is
presented
and
experiments
and
demonstrations
are
discussed
