on
accurate
floating
point
the
accumulation
of
floating
point
is
considered
on
a
computer
which
performs
t
digit
b
floating
point
with
exponents
in
the
range

m
m
an
algorithm
is
given
for
accurately
summing
n
t
digit
numbers
each
of
these
n
numbers
is
split
into
q
parts
forming
qn
t
digit
numbers
each
of
these
is
then
added
to
the
appropriate
one
of
n
auxiliary
t
digit
finally
the
accumulators
are
added
together
to
yield
the
computed
sum
in
all
qnn

floating

are
performed
under
usual
conditions
the
relative
error
in
the
computed
sum
is
at
most

some

further
with
an
additional
qn

additions
the
computed
sum
can
be
corrected
to
full
t
digit
for
example
for
the
ibm
360
b=16
t=14
m=63
m=64
typical
values
for
q
and
n
are
q=2
and
n=32
in
this
case
becomes
n
<=

and
we
have
