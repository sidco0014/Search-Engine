this
study
is
the
first
known
attempt
to
evaluate
two
such
systems
for
what
may
well
be
the
predominant
user
population
within
the
next
decade
the
who
as
nonprogrammers
are
using
the
computer
as
an
aid
in
decision

problem
solving
than
as
a
programming
end
in
itself
statistically
and
logically
significant
results
indicate
equal
cost
for
usage
of
the
two
computer
systems
however
a
much
higher
level
of
performance
is
attained
by
time
sharing
there
are
indications
that
significantly
lower
costs
would
have
resulted
if
the
time

had
stopped
work
when
they
reached
a
performance
level
equal
to
that
of
