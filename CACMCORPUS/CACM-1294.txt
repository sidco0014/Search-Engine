note
on
triple
precision
arithmetic
with
132
bit
in
a
recent
paper
gregory
and
raney
described
a
technique
for
double
precision
arithmetic
a
similar
technique
can
be
developed
for
triple
precision
arithmetic
and
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
note
to
describe
this
technique
only
the
multiplication
and
the
division
algorithms
are
described
since
the
addition
subtraction
can
be
obtained
by
a
trivial
modification
of
the
algorithm
in
gregorys
and
raneys
paper
