a
fast
method
for
solving
a
class
of
tridiagonal
linear
systems
the
solution
of
linear
systems
having
real
symmetric
diagonally
dominant
tridiagonal
coefficient
matrices
with
constant
diagonals
is
considered
it
is
proved
that
the
diagonals
of
the
lu
decomposition
converges
when
floating
point
it
is
also
proved
that
the
computed
lu
decomposition
converges
when
floating
point
is
used
and
that
the
limits
of
the
lu
diagonals
using
floating
point
are
roughly
within
machine
precision
of
the
limits
using
real
arithmetic
this
fact
is
exploited
to
reduce
the
number
of
floating
point
required
to
solve
a
linear
system
from

k
is
much
less
than
n
the
order
of
the
matrix
if
the
elements
of
the
subdiagonals
and
superdiagonals
are
1
then
only
4n2k

are
needed
the
entire
lu
decomposition
takes
k
words
of
storage
and
considerable
savings
in
array
subscripting
are
achieved
upper
and
lower
bounds
on
k
are
obtained
in
terms
of
the
ratio
of
the
coefficient
matrix
diagonal
constants
and
parameters
of
the
floating
point
system
various
generalizations
of
these
results
are
discussed
