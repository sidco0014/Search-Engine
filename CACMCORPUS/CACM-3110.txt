assembling
code
for
machines
with
span
dependent
many
modern
computers
contain
instructions
whose
lengths
depend
on
the
distance
from
a
given
instance
of
such
an
instruction
to
the
operand
of
that
instruction
this
paper
considers
the
problem
of
minimizing
the
lengths
of
programs
for
such
machines
an
efficient
solution
is
presented
for
the
case
in
which
the
operand
of
every
such
span
dependent
is
either
a
label
or
an
assembly
time
of
a
certain
restricted
formf
this
restriction
is
relaxed
by
allowing
these
operands
to
be
more
general
assembly
time
then
the
problem
is
shown
to
be
