a
computer
technique
for
displaying
n
dimensional
a
digital
computer
and
automatic
plotter
have
been
used
to
generate
three
dimensional
movies
of
the
three
dimensional
and
perspective
projections
of
four
dimensional
rotating
in
four
dimensional
the
observed
projections
and
their
motions
were
a
direct
extension
of
three
dimensional
but
no
profound
feeling
or
insight
into
the
fourth
spatial
dimension
was
obtained
the
technique
can
be
generalized
to
n
dimensions
applied
to
any
n
dimensional
or
hypersurface
