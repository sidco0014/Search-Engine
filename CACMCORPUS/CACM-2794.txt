proving
some
this
paper
suggests
a
bidirectional
relationship
between
state
space
problem
reduction
it
presents
a
formalism
based
on
multiple
input
multiple
output
which
provides
a
basis
for
viewing
the
two
types
of
representations
in
this
manner
a
representation
of
the
language
recognition
problem
which
is
based
on
the
cocke
parsing
algorithm
is
used
as
an
illustration
a
method
for
representing
problems
in
first
order
in
such
a
way
that
the
inference
system
employed
by
a
resolution
based
prover
determines
whether
the
set
of
clauses
is
interpreted
in
the
state
spacer
or
in
the
problem
reduction
is
presented
the
analogous
concepts
in
problem
reduction
theorem
proving
and
the
terminology
used
to
refer
to
them
are
noted
the
relationship
between
problem
reduction
resolution
and
linear
resolution
is
discussed
