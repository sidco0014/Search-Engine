context
sensitive
this
paper
presents
a
canonical
form
for
context
sensitive
and
a
parsing
algorithm
which
finds
each
context
sensitive
once
and
only
once
the
amount
of
memory
required
by
the
algorithm
is
essentially
no
more
than
the
required
to
store
a
single
complete
derivation
in
addition
a
modified
version
of
the
basic
algorithm
is
presented
which
blocks
infinite
analyses
for
grammars
which
contain
loops
the
algorithm
is
also
compared
with
several
previous
parsers
for
context
sensitive
and
general
rewriting
systems
and
the
difference
between
the
two
types
of
analyses
is
discussed
the
algorithm
appears
to
be
complementary
to
an
algorithm
by
s
kuno
in
several
respects
including
the
space
time
and
the
degree
of
context
dependence
involved
