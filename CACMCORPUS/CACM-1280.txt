of

differential
difference
with
a
decreasing
time
lag
in
which
variable
time
lags
present
are
of
common
occurrence
in
biology
variable

are
a

at
present
no
extensive
body
of
knowledge
exists
concerning
the
effects
which
these

can
cause
shown
here
is
a
method
of
reducing
some
differential
difference
to
ordinary
differential
equations
which
can
then
be
studied
numerically
with
ease
subsequent
study
will
deal
with
situations
in
which
multiple

lags
dependent
on
the
solution
itself
are
