a
statistical
comparison
of
the
primal
dual
the
more
commonly
used
primal
simplex
for
solving
linear
programming
problems
has
been
made
under
the
assumption
of
starting
with
a
full
artificial
basis
under
these
conditions
the
primal
dual
shows
a
statistically
significant
superiority
on
randomly
generated
problems
it
has
also
been
found
via
a
regression
analysis
that
the
relevant
parameters
in
determining
the
difference
in
the
number
of
iterations
between
the
algorithms
is
not
only
the
number
of
constraints
and
the
number
of
variables
but
also
the
ratio
of
the
latter
to
the
former
