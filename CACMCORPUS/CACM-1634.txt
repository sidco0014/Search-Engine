27
bits
are
not
enough
for
8
digit
from
the
inequality
10^8
<
2^27
we
are
likely
to
conclude
that
we
can
represent
8
digit
floating
point
accurately
by
27
bit
numbers
however
we
need
28
significant
bits
to
represent
some
8
digit
accurately
in
general
we
can
show
that
if
10^p
<
2^q
1
q
significant
bits
are
always
enough
for
p
digit
accuracy
finally
we
can
define
a
compact
27
bit
representation
that
will
give
28
significant
bits
for
numbers
of
practical
importance
